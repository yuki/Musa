iOS app which try to replace (or reimplement) original Music.app

## About
Since iOS 7, Apple has made a lot of modifications in its Music.app for iPhone. The new versions of the app gives more importance to the social media than to music, specially since iOS 9.

I have never made any app for iOS, so this is my opportunity to learn how to code in [Swift](https://swift.org/) for the iPhone.

My intention is to create a replacement for the original Music.app, to be more like the one that came with  iOS 7 and before.

This is my first iOS app, so you're welcome to fork the project and send me pull-requests ðŸ˜„

# Warning
This branch "swiftui" **is not finished**. This is a re-implementation using SwiftUI of the branch [master](https://github.com/yuki/Musa/tree/master) (which was done with Swift but using the older Interface Builder). If you want a "finished" app, go to the Master branch.
