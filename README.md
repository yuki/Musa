## About
Since iOS 7, Apple has made a lot of modifications in its Music.app for iPhone and iPod. The new versions of the app gives more importance to the social media than to music, specially since iOS 9.

I have never made any program for iOS, so this is my opportunity to learn how to code in [Swift](https://swift.org/) for the iPhone.

My intention is to create a replacement for the original Music.app, to be more like the one that came with  iOS 7 and before.

This is my first iOS app, so you're welcome to fork the project and send me pull-requests üòÑ

## How to test it
The source code is into **source** folder ;-)

### Requirements
* iOS 10.0+
* Swift 3.0+
* Xcode 8.0+
* [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) installed

### Installation
Checkout the project:

>git clone https://github.com/yuki/Musa.git

>cd Musa/source

Open the file **Musa.xcworkspace** in your Xcode and test **Musa** in your device.


## TO DO
 * Basic functionality, like iOS 6 (for me, the best version)
 * Landscape mode
   * Coverflow? (can be a good feature, or show albums like in iOS 7)
   * Make the player reorders itself
 * Gestures, to play next/previous song, to minimize the mini-player...
 * Extra features (all suggestions are welcome üòÅ )

## Thanks
