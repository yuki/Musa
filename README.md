## About
After upgrading to iOS 10, Apple's Music.app changed too much for me. The new version of the app gives more importance to the social media than to music.

I have never made any program in iOS, so this is my opportunity to learn how to code in Swift.

My intention is to create a replacement for the original Music.app, to be more like the one that come with  iOS 9 and before.

This is my first iOS app, so you're welcome to fork the project and send me requests :D

## Requirements
The source code is into **source** folder ;-)
* iOS 10.0+
* Swift 3.0+
* Xcode 8.0+

## TO DO
 * Basic functionality, like iOS 6
 * Coverflow? (can be a good feature)
 * Storage
