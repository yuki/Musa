## About
Since iOS 7, Apple has made a lot of modifications in its Music.app for iPhone. The new versions of the app gives more importance to the social media than to music, specially since iOS 9.

I have never made any app for iOS, so this is my opportunity to learn how to code in [Swift](https://swift.org/) for the iPhone.

My intention is to create a replacement for the original Music.app, to be more like the one that came with  iOS 7 and before.

This is my first iOS app, so you're welcome to fork the project and send me pull-requests üòÑ

## Features
 * Basic functionality, like iOS 6 (for me, the best version)
 * Landscape mode Music Player
 * Gestures, to play next/previous song, to minimize the player...
 * Extra features will be implemented
 * All suggestions are welcome üòÅ


## Requirements
* iOS 11.0+
* Swift 3.0+
* Xcode 8.0+
* [Cocoapods](http://cocoapods.org/) to install [MarqueeLabel](https://github.com/cbpowell/MarqueeLabel)


## How to test it
Checkout the project and do next steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/yuki/Musa.git
cd Musa/source
pod install
```

Open the file **Musa.xcworkspace** in your Xcode and test **Musa** in your device.
